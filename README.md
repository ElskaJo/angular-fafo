# angular-fafo
Let's finally learn angular by creating an app. What's it for? I have no idea yet. Will it work? Yet to be seen honestly. 

I am a UI designer, accessibility and UX consultant, CSS whisperer by default. JS isn't even entirely in my scope, though I'm learning vanilla JS to expand the requests I'm getting from work, with the end goal of being able to understand angular enough to get by. 

As I learn best by doing and figuring out, this project is just that. 
F*cking around and finding out. 

This repo is not to be taken as best practice, as even an example of what you should do with code. It's just me, out here trying to do everything mostly well.
